# JavaScriptCRUDApplication
A basic CRUD operation requires data. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete and these are four basic functions to manipulate data in a database. It can be any database. For my CRUD application, I am using data in a JSON object.
 I have data stored in a JSON object (in my application). I’ll extract the data and display it in a dynamically created HTML table.
 Each row has few more dynamically created HTML elements like buttons, textboxes and Dropdown Lists, to perform functions like, update, delete, save, create new and cancel.
 Button’s and textboxes will have events attached, dynamically.
 The application is a Books inventory. It will show a list of books, in a distinct category with a price. See the above image. This Application allows users to Views the list, create or add new books to the existing list (database), update or edit a rows data and delete the data (the entire row).
